/**
 * Apple Health sync types — shared SSOT for web and mobile.
 *
 * The Apple Health settings screen (mobile `apps/mobile/app/health-sync.tsx`,
 * web `app/settings/health/page.tsx`) lists six data types the user can opt
 * in or out of per-type. This file owns the canonical list + whether each
 * type is actually wired into `syncHealthData` today.
 *
 * Ported from the 2026-04-19 Claude Design prototype
 * (`docs/ux/claude-design-bundles/prototype/project/flows.jsx`, `HealthPage`).
 *
 * ─── Why an SSOT? ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Web and mobile render the same rows in the same order with the same
 * labels. Drift between platforms here would mean a user sees "Sleep" on
 * web but not on mobile, or the two in a different order. There is
 * currently no automated parity test pinning this order/labels — an
 * earlier version of this comment claimed one existed
 * (`tests/unit/healthSyncTypesParity.test.ts`), but it was never written
 * (see the ENG-1469 footer note below, which found and removed a dead
 * export referencing the same nonexistent file). Tracked in ENG-1584.
 *
 * ─── Why some are `supported: false`? ─────────────────────────────────
 * The prototype shows `Sleep`, but `apps/mobile/lib/healthSync.ts` does
 * not currently read `SleepAnalysis` samples. Per the project rule "no
 * UI element with no real backing logic", `Sleep` is rendered with its
 * toggle visually disabled and a "Coming soon" sub-label rather than
 * being shown as a fully functional opt-in. When the underlying sync is
 * wired, flip `supported` to `true` and the UI lights up automatically.
 * // deferred: see ENG-1584
