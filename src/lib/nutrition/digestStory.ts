/**
 * digestStory — pure builder for the always-visible "Week digest"
 * narrative block on Progress.
 *
 * Authority: D-2026-04-27-17 (Progress is a weekly story, not a
 * stat-card dashboard) + customer-lens audit 2026-04-30 (the 2x2 stat
 * grid still anchors visually after the Phase 4 refactor — demote, do
 * not delete).
 *
 * The narrative is the LEAD card on Progress. It reads as a story —
 * "this week you hit protein 4/7 days, calories ran 180 over, your
 * closest day was Tuesday" — calm, factual, no emoji, no motivational
 * tone. Numbers are the truth; copy is the wrapper.
 *
 * Distinct from:
 *   - `<ProgressHeadline>` (engine-led adaptive-TDEE recap line) —
 *     adaptive TDEE story, requires confidence ≥ medium.
 *   - `<Digest>` (the Sunday-evening recap card with share + dismiss)
 *     — only renders Sat 18:00 → Tue, dismissible per week.
 *
 * `<DigestStoryCard>` renders any time the user has any logged days
 * in the rolling window. Empty state ("Quiet week — log a meal to
 * start") is rendered by the consumer, not this builder.
 *
 * Voice rules (production design spec §1.7):
 *   - UK English: "behaviour", "personalise", "fibre", "kilocalories".
 *   - Second-person.
 *   - No exclamation marks. No "amazing!" / "you crushed it!". No emoji.
 *   - Restraint — no marketing tone.
 *
 * Pure module — no React, no I/O, no Date access.
