# Mobile App Changelog

## 2026-04-12 — Onboarding, Nutrition Accuracy, Search Improvements

### Onboarding Flow (NEW)
- **14-step guided onboarding** (`/onboarding`) — goal selection, body metrics, activity level, plan pace, calorie budget, nutrition strategy, calorie schedule, intermittent fasting, motivation/mindset questions, weight projection, summary
- **TDEE calculator** (`lib/tdee.ts`) — Mifflin-St Jeor equation with activity multiplier, safe 1200 cal floor, macro calculation per strategy (Balanced / High Protein / High Satisfaction / Low Carb)
- **Plan pace selection** — Relaxed (0.25 kg/wk) / Steady (0.5 kg/wk) / Accelerated (0.75 kg/wk) / Vigorous (1 kg/wk) with calculated calories and weeks-to-goal
- **Skip button** on every onboarding screen — marks onboarding complete, goes straight to app
- **Projection screen** — shows goal date with weight progress bar and summary of choices

### Authentication
- **Apple Sign-In** on login screen (iOS) via `expo-apple-authentication` + `signInWithIdToken`
- Login checks `profiles.onboarding_completed` to route new users to onboarding

### Subscription & Notifications
- **Paywall screen** (`/paywall`) — free trial flow with timeline (Program Created → Build Momentum → See Progress → Trial Ends), "Start Free Trial" + "Continue for free" buttons. Placeholder for RevenueCat/StoreKit integration.
- **Notifications prompt** (`/notifications-prompt`) — requests push notification permission with "Turn on" / "No thanks" options

### Nutrition Lookup Accuracy
- **Preserve nutrition-critical words** — "cooked", "raw", "dried", "frozen", "canned" are no longer stripped from USDA search queries (raw rice = 365 kcal/100g vs cooked = 130)
- **50+ UK/AU→USDA name aliases** — courgette→zucchini, minced beef→ground beef, prawns→shrimp, double cream→heavy cream, coriander→cilantro, butter beans→lima beans, aubergine→eggplant, etc.
- **Search Foundation/SR Legacy/Survey first** — generic whole foods before branded products, with USDA dataType API filter
- **Smart confidence scoring** — neutral USDA descriptors (raw, peeled, boneless) don't penalise; dish words (bread, cake, fried, oil) heavily penalise; prevents "Bread, zucchini" matching "zucchini"
- **Open Food Facts added to import pipeline** — searches between USDA and FatSecret for worldwide food coverage (UK/EU/global products)
- **Better small-item weights** — anchovy (5g), olive (5g), prawn (15g), mushroom (15g), deli meat slices (~10g)
- **Food-specific USDA portion weights** — uses USDA's portion data for the matched food instead of generic defaults
- **Error resilience** — USDA/FatSecret failures now fall through to estimation fallback instead of killing the entire pipeline

### Search UI
- **Unified search results** — single ranked list (no more "Products & Brands" / "Whole Foods (USDA)" section headers)
- **Progressive loading** — whichever source responds first shows results immediately
- **15s/12s timeouts** — USDA and OFF searches timeout gracefully on slow networks
- **MFP-style serving picker** — serving size (g, oz, tbsp, tsp, cup, ml + USDA portions) + number of servings input with decimal/fraction support

### Fibre/Micros
- `fiber_g`, `sugar_g`, `sodium_mg` columns added to `recipes` table and now saved during import and verification
- Recipe detail screen queries and displays fibre ring in Macronutrients card
- Verify screen totals include fibre/sugar/sodium
- Ingredient macros compute from actual ingredients (not stale recipe-level values)

### Import Pipeline
- **Amount/unit preserved** — parsed amounts and units from ingredient lines are now saved to the database (previously always null)
- **"heaped tbsp" parsing** — modifier words (heaped, level, rounded) before units are handled correctly
- **siteNutrition fallback** — if per-ingredient verification fails, recipe-level macros are populated from the site's JSON-LD nutrition data

### Shopping List
- **Generate Shopping List** button on planner — fetches ingredients from all planned recipes, merges duplicates, multiplies by recipe count, categorises (Meat & Fish, Dairy & Eggs, Carbs & Grains, Fruit & Veg, Pantry)
- Falls back to matching recipes by title when `recipeId` is null (older plans)

### Recipe Detail
- **Macros computed from ingredients** — calorie hero and macro rings always match the ingredient list (not stale recipe-level values)
- **Bookmark save button** — replaced star icon with bookmark matching library tab
- **YouTube thumbnail cleanup** — swaps hqdefault for maxresdefault (removes baked-in play button)
- **Save to Library works** — toggleSave correctly inserts/deletes from saves table

### Other
- **Nutrition sources page** (`/nutrition-sources`) — explains USDA, Open Food Facts, FatSecret with links, accessible from More tab
- **Ingredient name persisted** — when selecting a food from search, the matched name is saved (not the original raw ingredient text)

### Database Migrations
- `20260411180000_add_recipe_source_attribution.sql`
- `20260411200000_ensure_recipe_ingredients_micros.sql`
- `20260412100000_onboarding_profile_fields.sql` — adds `goal_weight_kg`, `plan_pace`, `nutrition_strategy`, `calorie_schedule`, `high_days`, `fasting_enabled`, `fasting_window`, `onboarding_completed`, `target_fiber`, `dob` to profiles; converts `weight_kg`/`height_cm` to numeric
