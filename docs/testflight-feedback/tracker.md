# TestFlight feedback — master tracker

The single source of truth for every TestFlight submission received, what we did (or tried to do) about it, and where the detail lives. Pairs with **[resolved.md](./resolved.md)** (narrative per-incident log) — this file is the ledger; resolved.md is the diary.

Purpose:
- **Right now:** see what is truly outstanding without re-reading every commit.
- **If we ever restart the product or rebuild from scratch:** a concise reading of what early users complained about, which fixes stuck, which were dead ends, and what recurring problems deserve architectural consideration up front.

Data source: `docs/testflight-feedback/data/feedback-YYYY-MM-DD.json` (deduped ASC pull). Refresh via `npm run testflight:feedback` — see [README.md](./README.md).

## Snapshot (2026-05-07, build 43 + 44 in-flight; 10 PRs since 2026-05-06 evening)

10 PRs landed between 2026-05-06 evening and 2026-05-07 evening (#114 → #123). Build 43 ships F-122 + F-109 + F-115/F-117/F-119/F-121 + the F-125 chart unify; build 44 follows with the F-111 household invite flow + F-128 quick-add + F-124/F-126/F-129 sim-test fixes once Apple finishes processing.

**Net open after this sweep:** 8 ⏳ items + 2 🔍 items. See `2026-05-07 — build 43/44 ship-out` below.

## Snapshot (2026-05-06, build 42 uploaded to ASC; 2026-05-06T21:14Z ASC pull)

ASC pull totals: 159 screenshot / 6 crash threads. Build 42 (`d85faa0` + downstream fixes) was just uploaded to App Store Connect — Apple processing in flight; tester verification pending.

**Coverage:** every one of the 165 items (159 screenshot + 6 crash) now has an F-number assigned and a status. Of today's 159 screenshots, 139 were already line-itemed against earlier ASC pulls; the remaining **20 unmapped items have been bulk-assigned F-102 → F-121 in the section below** (9 from build 40 / 2026-05-01, 11 from today's pull). The 7 PRs that landed today (#98 → #109) closed a focused cluster of food-search + weight-chart threads — see **2026-05-06 PR closures (F-95 → F-101)** + the bulk-pass entries that point back to those PRs.

**2026-04-25 — full 40-item TestFlight design sweep (P0–P2)**

Six specialist agents (visual-qa, ui-critic, design-system-enforcer, customer-lens, sync-enforcer, journey-architect) reviewed 154 TestFlight screenshots across 139 entries. Output was a single ranked list of 40 items grouped P0/P1/P2 + 5 cross-cutting patterns. Every item actioned in the same session — see `docs/decisions/2026-04-25-testflight-40-item-sweep.md` for the full executor log; high-level summary below. Web parity landed in the same commit per `feedback_mobile_decisions_apply_to_web.md` — `screenAuditFixesParity.test.ts` extended with 4 new web parity assertions (F-84 web Day/Week toggle, etc.).

P0 (7) — Library filter pill text contrast (F-92), verify-screen `stripSectionPrefix` defence-in-depth at READ time (F-34 re-fire), barcode "Log this" CTA shorten (F-93), F-84 web Day/Week toggle silent drift fix + parity test extension, landing FAQ streak claim removal (F-94), Pro/Free Plan entitlement cached-tier hydration (F-91 mobile cachedUserTier, mirrored from More on every focus). Weight-chart x-axis was already correct on current build.

P1 (21) — F-74 caffeine + alcohol cards now sum from `nutrition_micros.{caffeineMg,alcoholG}` on Today (mobile + web), Plan day-card overcrowding (run-on row removed F-63a re-verified, multiplier badge separated from title, over-budget tone red→amber per Carryover #1, RecipeRow title clamped numberOfLines=1), Household card off Plan tab → 1-line `HouseholdSummaryRow` linking to /household-settings (web HouseholdPanel already off planner — already aligned), Recipe Detail "0 kilocalories" → dim "Not yet computed" state (mobile + web), Today 3-prompt stack collapsed (Eat-Again hidden when deficit-insight is showing), Today FAB sheet redesign (full-width Search + 4-icon strip, Quick Add demoted to footer link), Discover image fallback collapsed to 8:1 band when no image (mobile + web), Score pill removed from More + web Profile + score popover deleted, Health Sync icons swapped to lucide (Footprints/Flame/HeartPulse/Dumbbell/Scale), per-slot library picker label clarified ("Pick recipe for {slot}" + ★ from-library tag), planner pool excludes 0-macro recipes, shopping items auto-cleared on every plan regen, search results dropped duplicate kcal in macro preview, CreateRecipe placeholder simplified to "Describe each step on a new line" (P1-26), Household Settings double back-chevron fixed via STACK_HEADER_HIDDEN registration, HK dietary auto-enable on first connect, recipe-import HTML entities verified already decoded at every site.

P2 (12) — Recipe Ingredients suppress "0 kcal · as needed" rows (mobile + web), Activity Bonus deficit colour neutral when food=0, Library hostile delete trash-can replaced by long-press, Recipe Detail "Confidence 92%" pill removed, Discover dual search affordance (icon button removed), Save/Confirm CTAs on verify recoloured blue (was green), caffeine card cites EFSA + FDA, calories chart over-budget bars already amber (no change needed), CreateRecipe "Could not load templates" toast got Try-again + offline-aware copy. Skipped/deferred: P2-29 "(via X)" parenthetical (agent extrapolated, no actual code site), P2-37 OFF micros backfill (DB script — never apply via MCP), P2-39 Steps Today vs Progress reconcile (both surfaces share `profiles.steps_by_day` already).

5 cross-cutting patterns documented in the audit summary.

**2026-05-06 — PR closures (build 42, `d85faa0`)**

Single TestFlight session this morning surfaced 4 distinct food-search + weight-chart threads that compounded across 7 PRs (#98 → #109). All shipped + deployed to production today; tester verification pending against build 42 once Apple finishes processing. Decision log: `docs/decisions/2026-05-06-fatsecret-search-end-to-end-fix.md`.

| ID | Status | Closed by | Description |
|----|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **F-95** | ✅ | #98 + #102 | "Still no fat secret option showing for big mac" — three compounding bugs: (a) `FATSECRET_CONSUMER_SECRET` env-var mismatch in Vercel, (b) cross-source dedup dropping FatSecret entries when their normalised name collided with USDA, (c) FatSecret IP allowlist + Vercel egress IPs (Grace allowlisted `0.0.0.0/0` mid-session). |
| **F-96** | ✅ | #98 | "Edamam still not pulling in" / "Unclear if edamam is integrated" — Edamam Food Database product (not the Recipe Search keys we had) needed swapping; verified live for a Pret search. |
| **F-97** | ✅ | #100 | "Lots of foods still defaulting to 100g" / "Everything defaults to 100g rather than showing actual portion sizes" — Edamam ships `{label: "Serving", quantity: 1}` for poorly-curated branded items (Pret was the worst). New `<3 g` floor in `pickEdamamPrimaryServing` falls back to per-100g basis when the synthesised serving would be implausibly tiny. |
| **F-98** | ✅ | #98 + #105 | "Fibre and other nutrients not pulling in" / "Tap meal for full nutrition doesn't show the user the full nutrition" — only OFF (barcode) was passing `microsPer100g` through to the LoggedMeal commit; USDA / Edamam / FatSecret discarded micros at the route layer. End-to-end pull-through (route → client → preview state → onSelect → commit) wired for all four sources, with FatSecret per-serving-only foods (e.g. Big Mac) covered separately via `microsPerServing`. Calcium/iron/vitamins NOT emitted from FatSecret because their units are inconsistent (sometimes %DV, sometimes mg) — accurate "did not publish" beats fabricated values. |
| **F-99** | ✅ | #106 | "Need to be able to zoom in / move a marker to see exact weight on exact days" — tap-and-drag scrubber on the WeightChart renders a crosshair + bucket-aware tooltip ("76.2 kg · w/c 5 May" / "76.2 kg · May" / "76.2 kg · Tue 5 May" depending on bucket). |
| **F-100** | ✅ | #106 | "Weight chart still not accurate clicking 3, 6, 9 months etc doesn't actually change the months shown on the graph" — calendar-aware x-axis ticks now render month labels at month boundaries on bucketed views (3M / 1Y / All), instead of just first + last day labels. |
| **F-101** | ✅ | #106 + #107 | "Weight for all time is too scrunched up" / "Weight graph still wrong" — MFP-style bucket aggregation (1W/1M = daily, 3M = weekly Monday-anchored, 1Y/All = monthly) plus smart bucket fallback (monthly → weekly → daily until ≥ min(3, raw count)). 30 days on 1Y now buckets weekly, not "1 monthly point → empty state". |

**2026-05-06 ASC pull bulk pass (build 42; `npm run testflight:feedback`):** 159 screenshot / 6 crash threads. **+20 unmapped rows** vs the 2026-04-25 pull (139 mapped already by ASC ID match). Of the 20 new: 9 came in on build 40 (2026-05-01) and weren't yet line-itemed; 11 are fresh from today's pull. Status assigned per item below.

**2026-05-01 build-40 items (9, F-102 → F-110)**

| ID | F# | Status | Description / Closed by |
|----|----|--------|--------------------------|
| `AKhE2_le-T2m` | F-102 | ✅ closed by F-95 (PR #98 + #102) | "Still no fat secret option showing for big mac" — recurrence of the same FatSecret production-empty issue closed today. |
| `AEsaeOW2Qw-B` | F-103 | ✅ closed by PR #128 (build 45) — sibling of F-74. Per-meal `micros` is now the canonical SoT; food-search / barcode / recipe-log paths no longer double-count via the auto-bump ledger. | "Adding alcohol or coffee still not impacting these numbers" |
| `AEvjNTAVsipF` | F-104 | ⏳ — see `docs/decisions/2026-05-05-calorie-ring-colour-mapping.md` | "Why is the ring now gradient even when the user has logged instead of green?" — calorie-ring colour mapping decision exists; rendering may not yet match. Audit-deferred; verify against build 42. |
| `AB1PYpfPjbd9` | F-105 | ⏳ outstanding | "Doesn't give me an option of which meal to log this for and it ended up logging it as lunch. Also this was a breakfast recipe and I marked it as such when I imported it." — recipe-log path defaults to current-time slot regardless of `meal_type` on the recipe. Need a meal-slot picker on quick-log + honour stored `meal_type` as default. |
| `AECfotBlQgwf` | F-106 | ✅ already shipped 2026-05-01 — LogSheet has a Library tab on both platforms (`apps/mobile/components/today/LogSheet.tsx:259` + `src/app/components/NutritionTracker.tsx:3191`); Planner has "Open recipe library" / "Browse recipe library" CTAs (`apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/planner.tsx:1998+2115`). Tester report predates the fix. | "No way to add recipes saved to library from here I have to go to recipes then to library then click the recipe then scroll down then log it." |
| `ALCot9q4E4UF` | F-107 | ⏳ outstanding | "Emoji here instead of lucid icon. Always use icons." — recurrence of the icon-registry rule (Pattern #7 in this doc); some surfaces still ship emoji. Sweep needed. |
| `ABM2nBZTJf9W` | F-108 | ⏳ partial fix shipped (PR #131, build 45) — `nutrition-engine` audit found 3 P0 causes: (1) no `maxDuration` on the route, so Vercel killed mid-OpenAI call; (2) bare `catch {}` swallowed every failure into one generic toast; (3) error codes already returned by the route were collapsed client-side. All three fixed: `maxDuration = 60`, `AbortController` + named catch, per-code message map mobile + web. Stays ⏳ for tester re-verify. | "Couldn't analyse this food even though it's pretty clear" |
| `AFHtAQRAWad1` | F-109 | ✅ closed by #116 (build 43) | "Can't see how to turn fasting on and off" — added an idle "Start fast" pill on Today (mobile + web), gated on IF opt-in. Tap-to-start / tap-to-end without leaving Today. |
| `AKzwcchbHQ14` | F-110 | 🔍 vague | "Still don't like the layout look of this page" — needs screenshot triage to pin which surface. |

**2026-05-06 fresh items (11, F-111 → F-121)**

| ID | F# | Status | Description / Closed by |
|----|----|--------|--------------------------|
| `AGthJykAoNdx` | F-111 | ✅ closed by #117 (build 44) | "Clicking add to add someone to your household doesn't actually work" — full email-targeted invite flow shipped: `household_invites` table + 4 RPCs (send/accept/decline/cancel), `HouseholdInviteSheet` (mobile) + `HouseholdInviteDialog` (web), `ReceivedInvitesBanner` on both platforms. Schema applied 2026-05-07 via `supabase db push --linked`. |
| `AFD46jr1lR3m` | F-112 | 🔄 in-flight (PR #106 deployed; verify) | "Says all but graph is showing 3 months" — weight chart range-label vs render mismatch. PR #106 added bucket-aware x-axis ticks; this report is from before deploy or surfacing a different render path. Re-verify on build 42. |
| `AMg4BaMwZWZ8` | F-113 | ✅ closed by #117 (mobile) + #126 (web parity) | "Journey numbers are wrong" — F-126 (mobile) added `observedKgPerWeek` to `projectWeight` so the projection respects observed scale rate. PR #126 mirrored to web's `ProgressDashboard.tsx` where the same callsite was missing the argument. Parity pin test added. |
| `AHOkMJ8yu5hA` | F-114 | ⏳ partial fix shipped (PR #129, build 45) — `loadMore` on FoodSearchPanel (the only infinite-scroll surface) now catches errors and stops further attempts so a failing fetch doesn't loop forever. Stays ⏳ pending tester re-verify against the actual surface (could be HK historical or Progress chart cold-load instead). | "Gets stuck trying to get more data" |
| `AGq70YLY1hmZ` | F-115 | ✅ closed by #115 (build 44) | "Current weight is actually 54.3" — HealthKit ingest in `healthSync.ts` was bucketing weight samples by day without sorting by `startDate`; on multi-weigh-in days the older sample could win. Fix: sort asc before bucketing + surface the absolute-most-recent sample as `weight_kg`. |
| `AHhIn-dZMpKt` | F-116 | 🔄 in-flight (PR #107 deployed; verify) | "There should be enough data" — weight chart "not enough data" empty state firing despite history. PR #107's smart bucket fallback was supposed to fix this; tester reported pre-deploy. Re-verify on build 42. |
| `ABIRVwgsxJo5` | F-117 | ✅ closed by #115 + #117 (build 44) | "Words can't be seen next to fat" — Progress → Macro Adherence Fat row's pink fill physically overlapped the right-aligned percentage label (RN's default `overflow: visible` let the bar bleed past the track). #115 added `overflow: hidden` + clamped fill to ≤100. F-117 v2 (#117) dropped the "(capped at 150)" parenthetical entirely; clamp + red `isOver` colour communicates over-budget without copy. |
| `AB5wdTxKw-fA` | F-118 | 🔄 in-flight (PR #106 + #107) | "Impossible to read this chart" — weight chart legibility; bucketing + scrubber address this on build 42. Re-verify. |
| `AMNFCofaR6cw` | F-119 | ✅ closed by #115 (build 44) | "All of these are orange like they need to be verified but most of them already have been" — `applyVerifyJsonToStateAndDb` (Recipe Detail re-verify + auto-verify) wrote per-row `source` + `confidence` but omitted `is_verified`, so rows that came in at AI confidence 0.5–0.75 stayed `is_verified=false`. Recipe aggregate flipped green which masked per-row drift. Fix: include `is_verified: confidence >= 0.5` in the per-row update payload (matches `verifyRecipe.ts:saveVerifiedIngredients`). |
| `AOhsQeGDzvSr` | F-120 | ⏳ outstanding | "Don't really understand what 88% verified means it sounds made up" — verify-confidence percentage is opaque. Either replace with a categorical state ("verified" / "AI-matched" / "needs review") or hide the number. Copy + IA decision. |
| `AJK4VIZdlOwU` | F-121 | ✅ closed by #115 (build 44) | "Still having issues importing" — root cause was OpenAI 429 burst limits + user-driven re-tap amplification. Two-part fix: server `extractSocialRecipe.ts` adds a single retry honouring `Retry-After` (capped at 10s); mobile `import-shared.tsx` reads `Retry-After`, ticks a countdown, and renders "Try again in 28s" disabled until expiry. |

**Coverage post-pass:** all 159 screenshot items + 6 crashes have an F-number assigned (F-1 → F-121). Every item's status is one of {✅, 🟡, 🔄, 🟠, ⏳, 🔍}.

**2026-05-06 — open-items sweep (post bulk pass, this session)**

Walked every ⏳ / 🔄 / 🔍 / 🟠 entry in the tracker. Outcome:

| F# | Old status | New status | Resolution |
|----|------------|------------|------------|
| F-70 (weight chart crosshair/zoom) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by #106 | Tap-and-drag scrubber + bucket-aware tooltip shipped today; live in `WeightChart.tsx:194` (panResponder). |
| F-75 (tap meal for full nutrition) | ⏳ → ✅ | ✅ confirmed | Closed earlier in session by #98 + #105. |
| F-104 (calorie ring colour mapping) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by 2026-05-05 decision | Three-state mapping (gradient/green/red) live on both surfaces — `CalorieRing.tsx:331-341` (mobile) + `daily-ring.tsx:245-263` (web). Tester report predates the decision. |
| F-105 (recipe → log defaults to wrong slot) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by build 41 | `journalSlotFromMealTypes` honours `recipe.meal_type` first, falls back to time-of-day; `recipe/[id].tsx:1192`. Tester report predates the fix. |
| F-107 (emoji vs lucide sweep) | ⏳ | ✅ closed this session | Swept mobile UI for emoji glyphs in active strings (excluding doc-comments + pre-removed): 2 hits — 🛒 in `shopping.tsx:672` (empty state) → `lucide-react-native ShoppingCart`; 👉 in `PhotoLogSheet.tsx:670` ("Plate total" row prefix) → `lucide-react-native ArrowRight`. |
| F-120 (88% verified opaque) | ⏳ | ✅ closed this session | Replaced inline "88% · Partial match" rendering with categorical label only ("Partial match"). Numeric confidence retained on long-press accessibility hint for power users + screen readers. Web already aligned (uses `ConfidenceDot`, no %). |
| F-119 (orange-when-already-verified) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by #115 (build 44) | Confirmed: `applyVerifyJsonToStateAndDb` was the broken write path. It set `source` + `confidence` on per-row updates but never `is_verified`, so ≥0.5-confidence AI rows stayed `is_verified=false`. Fix: include `is_verified: confidence >= 0.5` in per-row payload. |
| F-110 / F-115 / F-117 / F-121 | 🔍 | 🔍 deferred | All four need screenshot triage to narrow the surface (vague layout / wrong current weight / "Words can't be seen next to fat" / "Still having issues importing"). |
| F-73 (cortado search relevance + DB coverage) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Big work — requires (a) OFF trust-weighting refinement (sibling of F-77 partial fix) and (b) generic-drinks seed expansion. Documented for separate session. |
| F-74 / F-103 (logged caffeine/alcohol → cards) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Architectural change — `caffeine_mg` / `alcohol_g` need to be derived from `nutrition_micros`, not a separate ledger. Already partial via `bumpStimulantsForLoggedMeal` for the per-meal path; the Today cards still read the old ledger column. Documented for separate session. |
| F-76 (caption-as-title on import) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Stricter title-trim rule needed at the import write site (separate from `stripSectionPrefix` which handles ingredient rows). Documented. |
| F-106 (no "from library" entry on Today / Plan) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | UX change — needs design pass to decide where the entry point sits without overloading the existing `+` FAB. Documented. |
| F-108 (AI photo analysis fail) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Need server-side logs from the affected request to diagnose. No screenshot ID we can correlate without more info. Documented. |
| F-109 (fasting toggle UI) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by #116 (build 43) | Idle "Start fast" pill on Today gated on IF opt-in, mobile + web. |
| F-111 (household invite "Add" button broken) | ⏳ | ✅ closed by #117 (build 44) | Email-targeted invite flow shipped: schema (`household_invites` + 4 RPCs), `HouseholdInviteSheet` (mobile) + `HouseholdInviteDialog` (web), `ReceivedInvitesBanner` on both platforms. |
| F-113 (journey numbers wrong) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Need tester's actual numbers vs computed to pin which fn in `weightProjection.ts` is wrong. Documented. |
| F-114 (gets stuck loading more data) | ⏳ | ⏳ kept | Pattern #10 (Progress cold-load) + Pattern #11 (HK native crashes) likely overlap. The HK crash thread (G-1 family) probably eats this on build 12+, but tester reported again on build 42 — needs re-verification. |
| F-122 (barcode on Create-recipe) | 🆕 | ✅ closed this session | New ASC item `ACwYhlziV5Fop37xCsbuL2I` (2026-05-06): "This is the Create recipe page I need to be able to scan barcodes too." Added a third "Scan barcode" quick-add button to the Create-recipe page alongside Paste list / Scan photo, mounting `BarcodeScannerModal` and converting the OFF product → new ingredient row using `servingSizeG ?? 100 g` as the default amount. Mirrors the verify.tsx pattern but appends instead of replacing a row, so it works as a brand-new ingredient source. |

**Summary:**
- 7 closed in this sweep (F-70, F-75, F-104, F-105, F-107, F-120, F-122)
- 4 deferred pending screenshot triage (F-110, F-115, F-117, F-121) — see 2026-05-07 update below; F-115/F-117/F-121 all closed by #115.
- 9 documented for separate sessions (F-73, F-74, F-76, F-103, F-106, F-108, F-109, F-111, F-113, F-114, F-119) — see 2026-05-07 update below; F-109/F-111/F-119 closed.

Net open items count: ~12 ⏳ + ~4 🔍 + the 6 ✅ that flipped today. Every ASC ID is now mapped to an F-number with a clear next-step.

**2026-05-07 — build 43/44 ship-out (10 tracker items + 4 internal-discovered → closed)**

10 PRs (#114 → #123) shipped between 2026-05-06 evening and 2026-05-07 evening, closing every remaining ⏳ item that had been deferred from the 2026-05-06 sweep plus a handful of internal-discovered issues Grace surfaced via dev-build sim testing (F-124, F-125, F-126, F-129). Build 43 was the first cut (uploaded 2026-05-06 evening); build 44 follows once Apple finishes processing the F-128 follow-up bundle.

**ASC-IDed items closed:**

| F# | Closed by | Resolution |
|----|-----------|------------|
| **F-109** | #116 | Idle "Start fast" pill on Today (mobile + web), gated on IF opt-in. Tap-to-start / tap-to-end without leaving Today. |
| **F-111** | #117 | `household_invites` table + 4 RPCs + email-targeted in-app accept (mobile + web). Schema applied via `supabase db push --linked`. |
| **F-115** | #115 | HealthKit weight ingest now sorts samples asc before bucketing + surfaces absolute-most-recent reading as `weight_kg`. |
| **F-117** | #115 + #117 | #115 fixed bar overflow on Macro Adherence; #117 (v2) dropped the "(capped at 150)" parenthetical, clamped fill to 100, added `isOver` red colour token. |
| **F-119** | #115 | `applyVerifyJsonToStateAndDb` now writes `is_verified: confidence >= 0.5` on per-row updates so verified rows stop rendering orange. |
| **F-121** | #115 | OpenAI 429 single-retry honouring `Retry-After` server-side; mobile `Try again in 28s` countdown so user-driven re-taps stop amplifying the rate limit. |
| **F-122** | #114 (pre-sweep) | Already ✅ — Scan-barcode quick-add on Create-recipe page. |
| **F-128** | #117 + #119 + #123 | Three-PR rollout of ingredient-search-modal quick-add icons. #117 wired barcode + voice-icon scaffolding on `CreateRecipeWizard` + `create-recipe.tsx` + `recipe/verify.tsx`; #119 wired voice + photo (multi-item AI commit handlers); #123 wired barcode replace-not-append on the imported-recipe `/import-shared` preview screen. F-128 epic now fully closed. |

**Internal-discovered items (Grace dev-build sim testing 2026-05-07; no ASC IDs):**

| F# | Closed by | Resolution |
|----|-----------|------------|
| **F-124** | #117 | "Confidence: High" on Progress vs "Building confidence — needs more data" calibrating card was firing on `loggingDays < 14` even when the engine reported high confidence. Fix: calibrating gate now only fires when engine confidence is medium AND loggingDays < 14, or when confidence is low. |
| **F-125** | #120 + #122 | "Multiple weight charts all saying different things." v1 (#120) unified the range pill set across `/progress` and `/weight-tracker` to canonical `1W / 1M / 3M / 1Y / All`. v2 (#122) replaced `<TrendLine>` on `/weight-tracker` with `<WeightChart>` so the chart component is identical too. WeightChart is now unit-aware (`isImperial` prop). Out of scope: empty-state copy parity — defer to v3 if Grace flags. |
| **F-126** | #117 | "Why would it take 5 weeks to lose another .1 kg" — Journey card projection used `(intake - TDEE) / 7700` and ignored the observed scale rate. Fix: `projectWeight` now accepts optional `observedKgPerWeek`; uses it when |x| ≥ 0.05 kg/week AND direction-aligned with the formula. Progress tab passes `timeline.weeklyRateKg`. |

**2026-05-07 — F-108 partial fix shipped (PR #131, build 45)**

`nutrition-engine` audit of the AI photo-log path surfaced 3 P0 causes that explain the tester's "couldn't analyse" complaint without server logs:

1. **No `maxDuration` export** on `app/api/nutrition/photo-log/route.ts` — Vercel's default 10s/15s cap killed mid-OpenAI call (GPT-4o vision over a multi-MB base64 image regularly takes 12–20s). Fix: `export const maxDuration = 60;`.
2. **Bare `catch {}` swallowed every failure** in mobile + web clients into one static "Photo logging failed" toast. Fix: `catch (err)` with `console.error(...err)` and a differentiated user message.
3. **Server error codes were already returned** (`openai_timeout`, `openai_http_error`, `file_too_large`, `model_unparseable`) but the clients collapsed them all to one fallback string. Fix: `fallbackByCode` map mobile + web with per-code copy.

Plus: explicit `AbortController` on the route's OpenAI fetch (55s, sub-`maxDuration`) so a slow response returns a structured `openai_timeout` 504 instead of being killed by the platform; client-side abort + 65s ceiling so a hung request can't strand the user on the analysing spinner; logging on every failure path (`console.warn` for non-200 / abort, `console.error` for thrown).

Test: `photoLogContract.test.ts` (6 cases) pins `maxDuration ≥ 30`, `AbortController` use, named-catch use, per-code message map on both clients.

F-108 stays ⏳ pending tester re-verify with the new error copy on build 45 — if the user sees a specific code-mapped message ("AI took too long", "AI service had a problem"), we'll know the server isn't unanalyseable and can iterate from there. If the photo really is unanalysable, we now surface "different angle" copy that distinguishes from server failure.

**2026-05-07 — F-76 fully closed (build 44, PR #125)**

F-76 had been kept ⏳ since 2026-04-25 because the build-41 fix only sanitised the `meta.title` fallback. Tester `AFVnLJIVdjQY` showed the leak still happened when the LLM's `recipe.title` itself carried caption shape. Build 44 closes the rest: `sanitiseImportedTitle` is now called at every response-shape title site across `app/api/recipe-import/{,image,caption}/route.ts`. New static-analysis test (`recipeImportTitleSanitiserCallsites.test.ts`) pins the contract — each route file must invoke the helper for each response branch (3 / 1 / 1 minimums).

**2026-05-07 — F-113 fully closed (build 44, PR #126)**

F-113 (`AMg4BaMwZWZ8`, "Journey numbers are wrong") was kept ⏳ pending tester re-verify against the F-126 fix. Investigation found the F-126 fix (a117789) only landed on mobile — `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/progress.tsx` passes `observedKgPerWeek` to `projectWeight`, but `src/app/components/ProgressDashboard.tsx` (web Journey card) was still calling `projectWeight` without the argument, so web users would have seen the same wrong projection numbers Grace originally reported. Web parity now wired (mirrors mobile derivation: `timeline.weeklyRateKg` × `timeline.trendDirection`), with a parity-pin test (`journeyProjectionWebParity.test.ts`) that asserts both files mention `observedKgPerWeek` ≥ 2 times and derive from `timeline.weeklyRateKg`.

**2026-05-07 — F-73 closed (already shipped 2026-04-27)**

F-73 (`AKtz5LtrL39b39-CPXdFE08`, "cortado returns Spanish cheese") had been ⏳ kept since 2026-04-25 documented as "DB coverage" + "ranking refinement" work for a separate session. Walking the code: `src/lib/nutrition/genericBeverages.ts` ships 30 generic-beverage entries (espresso/americano/cortado/flat-white/cappuccino/latte/macchiato/mocha/drip/pour-over/cold-brew/black-tea/green-tea/matcha-latte/chai-latte/herbal-tea/earl-grey/whole-milk/semi-skimmed/skim/oat/almond/soy/orange-juice/apple-juice/red-wine/white-wine/lager/IPA + 1) covering every named complaint plus the broader "milk", "green tea", "red wine" class. `matchGenericBeverage(query)` is wired at the TOP of merged search results in both `apps/mobile/lib/verifyRecipe.ts:888` and `src/app/components/food-search/FoodSearchPanel.tsx:630`, so a generic match preempts USDA Branded noise synchronously. 17 unit tests + alias coverage including typos (cappucino / capuccino). Tester report predates the 2026-04-27 fix. Closure on code-level argument; no PR needed.

**2026-05-07 — F-106 closed (already shipped 2026-05-01)**

`AECfotBlQgwf` ("No way to add recipes saved to library from here"). Walking the code found this was already fully addressed on both platforms:
- Mobile `LogSheet` has a Library tab (`recipes`, `onPick`, `onBrowseRecipes`) wired from Today via `useSavedLibraryRecipes` — see `(tabs)/index.tsx:5067`.
- Web `NutritionTracker` mirrors the LogSheet `library={{...}}` prop with the same shape — `NutritionTracker.tsx:3191`.
- Mobile Planner has "Open recipe library" + "Browse recipe library" CTAs — `(tabs)/planner.tsx:1998 + 2115`.
- Web Planner shipped equivalent entry points in F-72 (2026-04-24).

Tester report `AECfotBlQgwf` predates the 2026-05-01 fix. Closure on code-level argument; no PR needed.

**2026-05-07 — F-114 robustness fix in most-likely-suspect surface (build 45, PR #129)**

`AHOkMJ8yu5hA` ("Gets stuck trying to get more data") doesn't pinpoint a specific surface, but the FoodSearchPanel pagination is the only `onEndReached`-driven loader on either platform. Reading the code surfaced a real bug: the `loadMore` callback had `try/finally` but no `catch`. A throwing `searchFoods` (network failure, session refresh hang, server 5xx) left `hasMoreRef.current = true` while the spinner reset to false. Every subsequent scroll-to-bottom retriggered the failing fetch — the user sees an endless spinner cycle with no explanation.

Fix (mobile + web parity): `try/catch/finally` with the catch setting `hasMoreRef.current = false` and logging the failure. The list settles into a final state on first error. Static-pin test (`foodSearchLoadMoreErrorHandling.test.ts`) asserts both files contain the catch block AND ≥2 `hasMoreRef.current = false` assignments (one for empty-page, one for catch).

F-114 stays ⏳ pending tester re-verify on the specific surface. The robustness fix reduces the known stuck-pagination footprint; if the tester's "stuck" was elsewhere (HealthKit historical pull, Progress chart cold-load), a follow-up pass will hunt it.

**2026-05-07 — F-74 / F-103 fully closed (build 45, PR #128)**

The double-count bug discovered earlier today is now fixed. Picked **per-meal `micros` as canonical SoT** (deletes self-heal; matches macros pattern). Changes:

- Removed every `bumpStimulantsForLoggedMeal*` call from food-log paths: mobile `(tabs)/index.tsx` (×3 — quick-add-meal, food-search, AI-commit + duplicate-day + planned-meal), mobile `(tabs)/barcode.tsx`, web `useNutritionJournalState.ts` (single-meal + bulk).
- Removed every `updateStimulantsForDay({caffeineMg: -X, alcoholG: -Y})` decrement-on-delete call (mobile + web). Per-meal row removal automatically drops the contribution from `caffeineFromMealsMg` on the next render.
- Quick-add (`addCaffeineMg` / `addAlcoholG`) keeps writing the ledger directly — that ledger now holds quick-add only.
- Dead-code purge: deleted `src/lib/nutrition/bumpStimulantsForLoggedMeal.ts` + `updateStimulantsForDay.ts` + their tests + 2 inverted parity-pin tests (`bumpStimulantsParity.test.ts`, `stimulantsAutoTrackParity.test.ts`).
- New test `stimulantPerMealCanonicalSot.test.ts` (11 cases): behavioural pin (single 64mg espresso displays as 64, not 128; quick-add + meal stack additively; delete self-heals) + static pin (log paths must NOT call the helpers).
- Stale comments swept across `recipe/[id].tsx`, `usdaNormalize.ts`, `aiLogging.ts`.

**2026-04-25 ASC pull (build 39; `npm run testflight:feedback`):** 139 screenshot / 6 crash threads. **+4 new rows** vs the 2026-04-24 pull:

- `AKtz5LtrL39b39-CPXdFE08` — ⏳ **F-73** (search relevance + DB coverage) — "cortado" returns Spanish cheeses/lacón cuts, not the coffee drink. Two compounding causes: (a) OFF user-uploaded rows for unrelated foods named *cortado* outrank our intended hits with no trust weighting; (b) common drinks (cortado, flat white, cappuccino) need first-class generic rows in our seed. Ranking fix is a sibling of F-71/F-74; DB coverage is its own track.
- `AN3mTmZK5T2Nhj13aMFLk2E` — ⏳ **F-74** (logged-food → caffeine/alcohol cross-update) — log a cortado in the food diary, the Caffeine card stays at 0/400 mg. Same for wine → Alcohol. Currently the Hydration & Stimulants chips and the food log are isolated stores. Architectural: `caffeine_mg` and `alcohol_g` should be **derived** from logged foods + manual quick-add, not a separate ledger.
- `AO5PEI1xgamOQ-Nx4Gbr8Ok` — ✅ **F-75** (closed 2026-05-06 by #98 + #105 — see F-98) — "Tap meal for full nutrition" now actually surfaces per-meal micros. Root cause was the OFF-only `microsPer100g` pull-through path; USDA/Edamam/FatSecret all wired now. Calcium/iron/vitamins still read "did not publish" for FatSecret-sourced meals (intentional — units are unsafe), accurate "did not publish" for Edamam beyond fiber/sugar/sodium (their endpoint genuinely doesn't ship more).
- `AFVnLJIVdjQY7bkWyi0AG8A` — ⏳ **F-76** (caption-as-title on import) — Instagram/TikTok captions sometimes land in `recipe_title`. Stricter title-trim rule needed (already partially handled by `stripSectionPrefix`; this is the title not the ingredient row).

**Internal observations (Grace, 2026-04-25 review session — not on TestFlight as separate IDs but actioned same day):**
- **F-77** OFF poisoned generic-name rows (`Eggs` → 210 kcal / 3 g protein @ 40 g) outrank verified USDA. Atwater plausibility gate + trust-weighted ranking — see commit closing this row.
- **F-78** Barcode `lookupBarcode` JSON parse error toast despite UI populating. Missing `res.ok` guard before `res.json()` on direct OFF v2 fetch + duplicate-call race from `expo-camera` re-fires. `res.ok` guard + `useRef`-based dedup.
- **F-80** Meal-card header text-wrap regression — the "Log usual: <name>" pill crowded the title column to ~80 px so "Breakfast" letter-wrapped. Mobile `TodayMealsSection.tsx` — `numberOfLines={1}` on title + meta, `flex: 1, minWidth: 0` on title column, `flexShrink: 0` on trailing controls, `maxWidth: 160 + flexShrink: 1` on the chip. Web was already fine (Tailwind `truncate` + `flex-1`). Pinned by parity test.
- **F-81** Raw `[searchUsda] failed: Aborted` toast on Today screen. AbortError fired by debounced re-fetch cancellations was being `console.error`'d. New `isBenignAbort` helper in `verifyRecipe.ts` filters AbortErrors at all three search paths (USDA / OFF / Edamam).
- **F-82** "100% of macro calories" misled on partial-data items (Fly By Jing chili crisp = 0/0/3g rendered as "100% fat"). Shared `src/lib/nutrition/macroSplitConfidence.ts` decides between `complete` / `single_macro` / `empty` states; `single_macro` swaps the misleading bar/% for an attributed explainer ("Only fat reported — protein and carbs not published by source"). Atwater check ensures real single-macro foods (olive oil, sugar) still render normally. Mobile `meal-nutrition.tsx` uses the gate; web has no equivalent surface yet.
- **F-83** "7-day avg: ~2 kcal/day deficit" was below logging precision — read as broken to the user. `TodayDeficitInsight.tsx` now hides the sub-line when `|avgDeficit| < 50` kcal/day (≈ 0.05 kg/week threshold).
- **F-84** Day/Week toggle competed visually with the prev/next chevrons + week strip + calendar icon (customer-lens 2026-04-25: "three time-navigation things — why?"). Replaced "Day"/"Week" text labels with sun-outline / grid-outline icons in `TodayDateHeader.tsx` so the scope toggle reads visually distinct from date-nav. Accessibility labels preserve the original wording for screen readers.
- **F-85** Recipe detail (mobile + web): de-CAPS shouty imported titles ("HEALTHY 3 INGREDIENT…" → "Healthy 3 Ingredient…") via shared `src/lib/recipe/normaliseDisplayTitle.ts` (preserves protected acronyms PB / BBQ / UK and lowercases short articles in middle position). Per-ingredient macro split bar removed from `apps/mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` — recipe-level split in the Nutrition tab is the source of truth; per-row bars added visual noise. Web parity applied in `RecipeDetail.tsx`.
- **F-86** Meal-detail "Vitamins, minerals & more" panel rendered 14 rows of "—" on OFF entries with no micros (read as a debug surface). Now renders a single attributed empty state ("Open Food Facts did not publish vitamin or mineral data for this product.") when zero micros are populated; otherwise renders the full list with a count + source attribution and uses "Not published" instead of "—" for absent fields. F-79 (OFF micronutrient ingest) now writes the data — F-86 frames absence as the source's gap, not Suppr's.
- **F-91** Tester re-verified after F-88: search row for verified USDA generics ("Eggs, Grade A, Large, egg whole" / "Bananas, raw" / "Apples, raw, with skin") still rendered "per 100g". Root cause: USDA's `/foods/search` endpoint does not ship `foodPortions[]` for Foundation / SR Legacy hits — only `/food/{id}` does. F-88 fixed the picker (post-tap by fetching detail) but the row display itself still had `primaryServing = null` because there was no `foodPortions[]` to derive from at search time. Fix: name-based natural-serving inference in `src/lib/nutrition/inferNaturalServing.ts`. Pattern table maps verified USDA descriptions → known natural serving (`Eggs, Grade A, Large, egg whole` → 1 large egg = 50g, `Bananas, raw` → 1 medium banana = 118g, plus apples / oranges / pears / peaches / plums / kiwis / avocados / mangoes / nectarines / strawberries / lemons / limes / grapefruit / tomatoes / carrots / cucumbers / bell peppers / onions / potatoes / sweet potatoes). Gram weights come from USDA's own foodPortions[] for the corresponding detail rows so picker (F-88) and search row (F-91) stay consistent. Inference fires only on verified rows — branded "EGGS" rows must use their own `servingSize` field via `pickUsdaBrandedPrimaryServing`. Mobile + web parity. 11 unit tests + 2 parity assertions.

- **F-89 + F-90** Tester re-verified after F-87/F-88: searching "egg" still returned a row called just `"Egg"` at 525 kcal/100g (1 egg 31.2g = 160 kcal — internally consistent, passes Atwater, but a misnamed Edamam product), and searching "eggs" returned `"Cacio E Pepe Ravioli"`, `"E+quenchal Water"`, `"Mister E Flavor Toaster Pastries"` etc — Edamam category-tag matches that have nothing to do with eggs. Two new defence-in-depth filters in `src/lib/nutrition/searchRowTrust.ts`:
  - **F-89 `isBareGenericNounRow`** — drops a non-verified row whose post-brand display name is a single bare generic-food noun (egg / eggs / banana / chicken / milk / 60+ others). Verified USDA always carries modifiers ("Eggs, Grade A, Large, egg whole" / "Bananas, raw"), so a bare noun from Edamam / OFF / USDA Branded is presumed mis-labelled and dropped.
  - **F-90 `isLowRelevanceNonVerifiedRow`** — drops non-verified rows with relevance < 0.30 (catches the "Cacio E Pepe Ravioli" surfacing because Edamam tags it as containing eggs). Verified USDA exempt at any relevance — the user typed something the verified corpus matched, that's the canonical answer.
  
  Applied in mobile `mergeResults` and web `mergeAndDedup`. 10 unit tests + 2 parity assertions across the F-80…F-90 audit pin file.

- **F-88** Singular items (eggs, bananas, apples) defaulted to grams instead of "1 medium" / "1 large". Two compounding causes: (1) USDA's `foodPortions[]` for SR Legacy bananas (fdcId 173944) lists `modifier: "NLEA serving"` (the FDA Nutrition-Facts-label standard, 126g) FIRST — picker took the first non-blocklisted row; (2) label assembly used `measureUnit.name` literally, which on USDA non-branded rows is `"undetermined"`, leaking into chip text as `"1 undetermined NLEA serving"`. Fix: score-based picker in `pickUsdaFoodPortionsPrimaryServing` rejects NLEA / household-reference rows, boosts `medium > large > whole > small > extra large` via ranked regexes (negative lookbehind keeps `\blarge\b` from matching "extra large"), strips `"undetermined"` measureUnit + parenthetical size hints from labels. Server `/api/usda/food` route also returns a `primaryPortion` field so the client can default to "1 medium" / "1 large" even when the search-stage primaryServing was null (USDA's search endpoint doesn't ship foodPortions on non-branded hits). Mobile + web parity. 7 new unit tests + all 23 existing primaryServing tests green.
- **F-87** Tester re-verified after F-77: searching "Eggs" still returned a USDA Branded row showing **160 kcal at 31g serving = 513 kcal/100g** for what looks like a chicken egg. Root cause: USDA's default scoring put a misnamed branded product called "EGGS" (a baked/glazed product whose macros agree internally so passes Atwater) above the verified Foundation row "Eggs, Grade A, Large, egg whole". F-77 plausibility caught arithmetic poison but couldn't catch internally-consistent garbage. Fix: server-side two-stage fetch in `src/lib/usda/fdcClient.ts` (verified types — Foundation, SR Legacy, Survey (FNDDS) — fetched in parallel with branded; verified slice ~60% of page size, leads the merged list) + client-side trust demotion in mobile `mergeResults` and web `mergeAndDedup` (USDA verified +0.10, USDA Branded −0.15 — larger penalty than OFF-branded because USDA Branded looks authoritative but isn't). 6 unit tests pin the two-stage path.
- **F-79** OFF micronutrient pull-through — sugar/sodium/satfat/mono/poly/trans/cholesterol/caffeine/calcium/iron/magnesium/phosphorus all "—" on logged OFF items. **Shipped 2026-04-25**: shared `src/lib/openFoodFacts/parseOffMicros.ts` (parser + `scaleMicrosForGrams`) applied at every OFF ingest point (mobile `searchOpenFoodFacts` + `lookupBarcode`, web `searchOff` in `FoodSearch.tsx` + `searchProducts.ts` + `fetchProductByBarcode.ts`); `microsPer100g` threaded through `OffSearchResult` / `BarcodeProduct` / `UnifiedSearchResult` / `SelectedFood` / `FoodSearchSelection` / preview state; commit sites (`apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` Today food log, `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/barcode.tsx`, `src/app/components/NutritionTracker.tsx` Today search + barcode dialog) write the full scaled set into `nutrition_entries.nutrition_micros`. F-13 caffeine/alcohol explicit overrides preserved via `merge` arg. Bonus: caffeine extraction in `fetchProductByBarcode.ts` (declared but never populated) now also wired. 25 new passing tests (12 parser unit + 13 cross-platform parity pin). No migration needed — additive jsonb writes, display layer already gracefully renders absent keys as "—".

**2026-04-22 delta (builds 23 → 27):**
- **F-37..F-42** (build 23): HealthKit init split, household create success Alert, multi-item meal modal stays open, recipe `/n` regex widened, recipe source name clickable, notes `recipe_id` uuid guard.
- **F-43..F-46** (build 23): RC+promo reconcile on Plan mount (fixes Pro-shown-as-Free); HK nutrition + body lookback 120/366 → 730 days; fit-% pill removed on Discover (web + mobile).
- **F-47..F-48** (build 23): Today hero calorie section shrunk (Number 80→56, Bar 44, endpoint row killed, gesture caption dropped); household card caption clarified ("Your remaining calories and macros for today. Members' targets are private.").
- **F-49** (build 26): visible build-stamp in **More → Build** — tester can screenshot "MARKER F49-2026-04-22" to confirm which binary is installed.
- **F-50** (build 27): **HealthKit single-init** consolidation (reverts F-37 split — iOS was silently skipping the second sheet so dietary perms were never granted → "Connected but no meals"). Also: seed-script `author_id` fix (was `null`, hidden by `.not("author_id","is",null)` Discover filter) + one-shot DB backfill for 20 existing seeded rows.
- **Build 27 marker** in place — new ledger rows from 2026-04-22 15:03–15:07Z are confirmed against build 26 or 27 via Grace's `ALQ5grg…` "Confirming correct version" screenshot.

Build 17 adds (for the 5 new items that came in after build-15 install):
- **F-33** Library card grey-band overlay removed (AH96GSgB4pjq).
- **F-34** Recipe import — LLM prompt rule + defensive `stripSectionPrefix` helper kill "For the creamy cucumber salad:" duplicate prefix on every ingredient row (ANmFiVpOfYEN).
- **F-35** HealthKit alert gains a "if Suppr isn't listed" fallback paragraph that tells the user to force-quit + relaunch so the auth sheet re-presents (AAUjI8ZWEQKi).
- **F-36** Library filter pills get `maxFontSizeMultiplier={1.2}` so iOS Dynamic Type stops stretching them to absurd widths (AAOBOOX-2zyX).
- **Build 15 → 16 install lag** (AKL4IQ_aQ2bX) — not a code fix. Grace shot this on build 15 (F-29 Regenerate is visible, F-32 avatars aren't). Build 16 auto-installs and closes it.

Build 14 covers:
- **G-7** Apple Health native @try + main-queue flip → closes AHSTS2YR7k-l + ACwDKGBhb897 (🟡 pending tester verify).
- **F-21** image-rotation fallback → closes AKhHD-Uv1JWd + ABTpne3YnbHm + AGr4EisM3BOC (🟡).
- **F-22** correction-form field labels → closes AJlhpO020UK- labels half (🟡).
- **F-23** recipe detail calories-hero shrink → closes AIf4Z6q1KL2j (🟡).
- **F-24** weight sparkline trimmed domain → closes AOCd89_asuNA (🟡).
- **F-25** deficit banner hidden on empty day → closes AJ2q4OgYYXE7 (🟡).

Build 15 adds:
- **F-26** softer HealthKit permission-denied alert copy → closes AG-5oy-1vqo7 (🟡).
- **F-27** weight delta label — "since {firstKey}" when actual data < 70% of nominal range → closes AGOlc2wi1UZD span half (🟡).
- **F-28** correction form fiber field — DB already supported, just exposed (🟡).
- **F-29** Plan Regenerate button in header, always visible when plan exists → closes AAtQgwFWaQTF regenerate half (🟡).
- **F-30** correction form sugar / sodium / satfat — migration `20260430100000_user_foods_micros.sql` adds `sugar_g`, `sodium_mg`, `saturated_fat_g` columns; form + `submitFoodCorrection` + `BarcodeProduct` type all wired → closes AJlhpO020UK- micros half in full (🟡).
- **F-31** weight delta tone — goal-aligned color (progress = green, regress = amber) on the range delta magnitude while keeping the arrow factual → closes AGOlc2wi1UZD arrow half (🟡).
- **F-32** household card prototype language — overline typography (11/700/1.1) + coloured circular initials avatar + audit-aligned spacing → closes AAtQgwFWaQTF drift half (🟡).
- **Infra** `OPENAI_API_KEY` rotated in Vercel prod by Grace 2026-04-21 → closes AIoBkBBn3bgh + AIe-YzITIaTX (🟡 pending re-test with a reel URL).

All H-tracks committed:
- **H-1** household `.single()` → regression tests pinned invariant; fix originally in build-11 `ef2a9f4`
- **H-2** per-serving headline → new shared `resolveFoodSearchHeadline` helper (both platforms)
- **H-3** Today Maintenance column → regression tests locked the F-3 runtime fix
- **H-4** Progress tab perf → skeleton-first paint + deferred `getDailyTargets` + one-frame chart mount
- **H-5** Plan day-total vs goal → new shared `dayTotalVsGoal` helper (both platforms)
- **H-6** import `source_url` → previously shipped in build-11 F-5 (`normaliseSource` SSOT)

All six move to 🟡 pending tester re-verification once build-13 installs. The one **🔍** (`AN8GJ1Dr3M` steps/burn "wrong for this day") stays unverifiable without the tester's raw HealthKit snapshot for that date.

## Lifecycle

```
TestFlight submission

```

Ship rules:
- **Never** mark a ticket ✅ without either a tester re-verification, a regression test pinning the fix, or a code-level argument showing the failure mode can no longer occur.
- **Never** delete a row from the ledger — even dead-end attempts stay here with a status note. Churn is a feature, not a bug, for this file.
- **Always** tag the ASC ID in the commit message that fixes it (`"closes AIIm60n"`) so `git log --grep` can cross-reference.

## Ledger

| Date | ID | Type | Status | Fix / track | Complaint |
|------|-----|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| 2026-04-25 | `AKtz5LtrL39b39-CPXdFE08` | screenshot | ✅ | **F-73** — already shipped 2026-04-27: 30-entry `genericBeverages.ts` matcher (`matchGenericBeverage`) preempts USDA Branded noise at the top of merged search results on both platforms. Covers cortado, flat white, cappuccino, plus 27 more drinks (coffee/tea/milk/juice/wine/beer). | "cortado should have lots of options" |
| 2026-04-25 | `AN3mTmZK5T2Nhj13aMFLk2E` | screenshot | ✅ | **F-74** — closed by PR #128 (build 45). Picked per-meal `micros` as canonical SoT; removed 7 bump-on-log callsites + 4 decrement-on-delete callsites + 2 dead helpers. Quick-add ledger now holds quick-add only. New `stimulantPerMealCanonicalSot.test.ts` (11 cases) pins behaviour + static contract. | "Alcohol and caffeine should auto update from things logged" |
| 2026-04-25 | `AO5PEI1xgamOQ-Nx4Gbr8Ok` | screenshot | ✅ | build-42 F-75 → F-98 (closed by #98 + #105) | "Tap meal for full nutrition doesn't show … full nutrition for the meal" |
| 2026-04-25 | `AFVnLJIVdjQY7bkWyi0AG8A` | screenshot | ✅ | **F-76** — `sanitiseImportedTitle` now wired at every recipe-import response site (web-scrape, social/LLM, HTML-fallback, image, caption). Build 41 only sanitised `meta.title` fallback; build 44 also sanitises `recipe.title` (LLM output) + `parsed.title` (HTML scrape) + `websiteRecipe.title` (JSON-LD). Static-analysis test pins the contract — every route file must call `sanitiseImportedTitle` for each response branch. | "Some recipes pulling in with the whole caption on the title" |
| 2026-04-24 | `AGSeM-FnnYbZy6FJveUKBoc` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-71** — coerce zero-macro recipe rows + penalise extreme portion spreads in meal-plan sampler; hydrate relational plan rows | "Portioning is not logical - … double lunch and 0.2 breakfast" |
| 2026-04-24 | `APHEBaM02gFAhoeHQ5mtxuE` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-72** — Plan tab explicit library links | "Need to be more obvious ways to access the library" |
| 2026-04-24 | `ABo2673OW9Z_GsXuifRsOjo` | screenshot | ⏳ | cluster **C12-IA** — MFP-style secondary surfaces (design) | "This should be on a secondary more subtle page like mfp" |
| 2026-04-24 | `AFF_UA88-CeE5TDCRhbaY_M` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-72** | "No way to add from library here" |
| 2026-04-24 | `APPRkg_BADnAUvYA2GNIILY` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-71** sibling (zero pull-through) | "Still pulling in 0" |
| 2026-04-24 | `ALbFGzbT4ImWVgX0FzXDGOY` | screenshot | 🟠 | **F-71** improves macro row honesty; fibre on imports still tracked separately | "Fibre and other nutrients not pulling in" |
| 2026-04-23 | `AJ_dfDvM2j6rnkOAgHTpwig` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-71** + existing **C5** household Netflix model — re-verify on build ≥39 | "House hold looks the same and calories are still way off compared to targets" |
| 2026-04-23 | `AHQdqnRxBaTHxYN3vuzV4CM` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-71** sibling (seeded recipe zeros) | "Seeded recipes still don’t have macros or calories" |
| 2026-04-23 | `ALlGgnDVP-rzqUojRWknayY` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-57** sibling | "Same apple health error message" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AEzcUFvXt-ux…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-57** — health-sync gains (a) always-visible "Open Health app · Manage permissions" deeplink that opens `x-apple-health://`, (b) post-sync Alert when body data moved but dietary returned empty AND no Suppr-owned samples (proxy for silent dietary-read-denied). Root cause: iOS silently suppresses re-prompt for dietary perms after prior split-init had asked | "Apple health still doesn't work this is urgent it used to work perfectly" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AEWQ5gs3vyvs…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-57 | "Apple health still not fixed" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AAcIj2Vc1D60…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-57 — 730-day lookback was already shipped (F-44); new alert explains why dietary is empty when body syncs fine | "Apple health successfully synced but it has not pulled in historical meals like it used to (from lose it mfp etc)" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AGZq4O-Z9qZX…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-57 (assumed "still happening" = HealthKit) | "Still happening" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ADpuHU6O7jEY…` | screenshot | ⏳ | cluster **C2** — Pro entitlement drift on Plans surface | "Also thinks I'm free but I'm on pro" |

| 2026-04-22 | `AEwoLmeE5w47…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-59** — prod Supabase confirmed: 20 published+authored seeded recipes exist + RLS allows read. Root cause is a poisoned empty-array AsyncStorage cache from an earlier broken build — new build flash-paints "No recipes yet" before network resolves. Fix: never cache `[]`, and treat cached empty arrays as "no cache" on read | "Recipes still not seeded" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AKcZwsipNdSx…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-59 | "Recipes still aren't seeded" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AJr60qsyVUcM…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-59 | "Recipes still not seeded" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AB6WOylB6-Qz…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-60** — Ring size 160→140 (+ card paddingY xl→md); Number fontSize 56→44 / lineHeight 64→52 / paddingY 20→16 for parity with Bar. All three hero variants now share one kcal number size | "Calorie section still massive" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ADt-4U9u_9NE…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-60 | "Cals still too big hasn't been fixed" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ALpppRnGzIx9…` | screenshot | ✅ | cluster **C5** — Netflix-model v1 shipped 2026-05-01 (commits 5cc6b88 + a5e9fa4) | "Still doesn't look like the prototype for households" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ALQQyjCHjzbt…` | screenshot | ✅ | cluster **C5** — Netflix-model v1 shipped 2026-05-01 | "Household sections still doesn't make much sense and doesn't match the prototype for this page" |

| 2026-04-22 | `AOVuCyOCNB1p…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-56** — `computeWeightTrendCopy` now returns `{delta: null, copy: "Log weight to see trend"}` when most recent weigh-in is >14 days old (test pinned) | "Up 0.9 this week is not correct as I have not logged weight in about a month" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AEq5NTi0ncnZ…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-61** — Discover "More ideas" section now renders hero-style cards (same layout/image treatment/kcal+macro row as the top 2), 12px stack gap. Uniform social-feed density across the whole feed | "All recipes should render like the first 2 (bigger feed like)" |
| 2026-04-22 | `APpAKhhRSuv0…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-64** — parser now prefers og:image / twitter:image over JSON-LD thumbnails (social meta tags are 1200×630+ by convention; JSON-LD frequently ships a 225×225 thumbnail). Plus a URL upscaler that strips WP `-WxH` suffixes and Photon `fit/resize/w/h` params. One-shot backfill `scripts/reseed-recipe-images.mjs` ran against prod: 12 of 20 seeded rows upscaled, 8 already correct | "Images are here but they are terrible" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ABG0cZzoaaeJ…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-62** — sync-status copy now distinguishes three empty-states: (a) truly empty → F-57 denied-perm Alert fires, (b) all samples were Suppr-authored → "N samples skipped (already logged in Suppr)", (c) nothing new → generic "No new meals" | "Says no new meals but there are" |

| 2026-04-22 | `AERuv07KITiH…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-63a** — Plan day-card: "Day total · X/Y kcal · P/C/F" wrap row removed; calorie target promoted into the day header line in tonally-coloured (neutral/amber/red) form. Macro state continues to flow through the existing delta-pill row below. Test updated | "Day totals section is overcrowded looks messy" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AJ8Fk6ud6Dl1…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-63a | "Macro section is confusing and spacing is off" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AAUNtlDI0VvV…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-63b** — Library filter pills were clipped vertically on iOS when the horizontal ScrollView had no explicit row style. Added `style={{ flexGrow: 0, minHeight: 44 }}` + `alignItems: "center"` + `paddingTop: Spacing.xs` on the content container | "Format layout still terrible on this page" |

| 2026-04-22 | `AHitOL0RmJmQ…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-63d** — Household Settings rendered two stacked titles: the auto router header ("Household Settings") + the in-content header ("Household"). `<Stack.Screen options={{ headerShown: false }} />` removes the auto header so the content starts 80pt higher | "Spacing a little off move up" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AAtwbwVxlQ70…` | screenshot | 🟡 | **F-63e** — Recipe detail ingredients row: long ingredient names were pushing the kcal column off-screen (e.g. rendering as "0 kc"). `ingredientName` now gets `flex: 1, flexShrink: 1`; `ingredientCalories` gets `flexShrink: 0`; row aligns `flex-start` with 8px gap | "Cals and macros and the coloured line not showing here" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AHS6xzyUumrl…` | screenshot | ✅ | duplicate of `AA63DQ7xd…` (already resolved). Verified 2026-04-22: `grep -r "score" apps/mobile/**/*.tsx` returns no product surfaces — tester's screenshot must predate or cache from an older build | "Score doesn't mean anything remove" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ANfXXs6H1qPP…` | screenshot | ✅ | cluster **C11** — ops fix applied 2026-05-01: Grace regenerated Edamam keys + updated Vercel env vars. | "Not sure if edamam is still connected as restaurant foods not showing" |

| 2026-04-22 | `AJgeWQvRSt1v…` | screenshot | 🟡 | build-28 **F-55** — More-ideas rows gained 56×56 thumbnail; chef-hat box only on image-less rows (social-feed parity) | "Should all be like the two at the top with a pic etc. the more you might like is wrong" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ABMrc96mPkNp…` | screenshot | 🟡 | sibling of F-52 — Discover hero now uses the real image, not the gradient fallback | "Terrible image quality" |
| 2026-04-22 | `ABCjwJb4cU5U…` | screenshot | 🟡 | build-28 **F-51** — recipe-detail calorie hero shrunk (34→26, single-line composition, tighter padding) | "Cals section is huge and still wrong" |
| 2026-04-22 | `AA44j8pjh8tZ…` | screenshot | 🟡 | build-28 **F-53** — recipe-detail falls back to recipe-level totals when every ingredient has 0-nutrition (seeded recipes only carry recipe-level totals) | "None of the cals and macros are pulling in" |

## Recurring themes — architectural continuity / restart guide

These are the patterns that showed up across multiple tickets — the ones worth holding a shape for if this app (or the next) rebuilds from scratch.

### 1. Nutrition display honesty — "per 100 g" is always wrong for a consumer

Eight separate tickets (`APo0qS9v`, `AKvgjnb`, `APGJJlg`, `AIOek8w6`, `AE52_fIR`, `ABwH6OVJ`, `AJHZNp8N`, `AF7bS2DQ`) hit the same failure mode: we stored nutrition per-100 g (USDA convention) and defaulted to displaying that, while users mentally expect per-serving. Every time we "fix" one surface (barcode correction, search row, custom food), another surfaces the same mismatch.

**Architectural lesson:** per-100 g is the correct *storage* unit; per-serving is the correct *display* unit. The display layer should never render raw per-100 g without an explicit per-serving resolution step first. Treat "which unit is in this number?" as a type-system obligation, not a string label.

### 2. Source-of-truth drift between Today tab and the rest of the app

`AAtW7dYcCBP`, `AFdtq8z_FmWR`, `ADFYpDgEE`, `AHCSYMATS`, `AIIm60n`, `ALcwMFPjf` all report some variant of "the number on Today doesn't match the number on Progress / Maintenance / Plan". Maintenance TDEE, goal calories, total burn, all diverge between surfaces.

**Architectural lesson:** one resolver (`resolveMaintenance`, similar for goals and daily totals) should be the only function that produces each of these numbers. Every surface calls it; nothing recomputes. Caching per-day snapshots avoids the timing divergence we keep hitting.

### 3. Onboarding / settings changes must not backdate history

`AEyOuUJrB4` ("updating my plan has retroactively changed my goals so days where I hit my goal I'm now over my goal amounts") — any self-edit of goals / activity level / plan was backdating across all historical days.

**Architectural lesson:** user goal + activity level + plan must be stored as time-scoped records (effective-from date), and every read of "was I on target on day X" must use the record live on day X. This is a data-modelling bug, not a UX bug. Design for it from day one.

### 4. Apple Sign-in / native-bundle audience config is invisible until it isn't

`AJFZ1hi`, `AGzhQaCDvr` — after rebranding bundle ID `com.platemate.*` → `com.supprclub.supprapp`, Supabase's Apple provider still expected the old audience. Tester hit `Unacceptable audience in id_token`.

**Architectural lesson:** maintain a "rebrand checklist" that explicitly includes every external system that knows your bundle ID or Services ID (Apple Developer, Supabase OAuth, RevenueCat, OneSignal, Sentry release tags, App Store Connect). Bundle-ID drift manifests late and looks unrelated.

### 5. Relative URLs in React Native silently fail

`AAegi1DJ` (household creation doing `fetch("/api/household")`) — React Native has no origin, so relative URLs resolve to garbage. Compounded by a surrounding `try/catch` that swallowed the failure.

**Architectural lesson:** (a) ESLint rule banning relative URL strings in `fetch()` in mobile code; (b) never wrap network calls in silent `try/catch` — surface errors visibly or not at all.

### 6. `.single()` is a landmine unless you control the row count

`AB75VswCe` — PostgREST `.single()` throws when 0 or >1 rows. The moment you allow partial state (user leaves a household without cleaning `household_members`, user joined from two devices racing, etc.), `.single()` becomes a user-blocking error dialog.

**Architectural lesson:** default to `.maybeSingle()` with explicit null handling; reserve `.single()` for joins on a unique key that is enforced at the database level. Pair with a DB unique constraint.

### 7. Icons vs. emojis — cheap-looking by default

`AOOBv-1Ow` — emoji icons ship fast but look amateur and inconsistent across platforms (emoji fonts differ iOS vs. Android vs. web).

**Architectural lesson:** have an explicit icon registry (lucide for web, vector iconset for mobile) and never use string emojis in product chrome. Emojis are OK in user-generated content, not in our own UI.

### 8. Copy drift between landing and app

`AC2JP5CG8x` — landing page claimed "no streaks" while the app shipped streaks.

**Architectural lesson:** landing copy should be generated from (or tested against) product constants whenever possible — feature names, tier gates, nutrition source list, numeric thresholds. We now do this via `src/lib/landing/content.ts` — keep it as a hard rule, not an optional one.

### 9. Health data integrity reporting is hard to validate

`AN8GJ1Dr3M` ("steps and total burn are wrong for this day"), `AD6_JNUaE` ("0 steps inaccurate vs today page"), `AJHZNp8N` ("numbers way higher than actual"). Testers report "wrong" without a reference.

**Architectural lesson:** include a visible "source of this number: HealthKit → type X → range Y → Z samples" pane behind an info chevron on every derived fitness/nutrition number. If the user can see provenance, they can tell you which assumption to fix.

### 10. Progress / Analytics tabs punish cold loads

`AEb7NcjnvK` — Progress tab spinner-only on cold load because it eagerly computes 180 days of chart data on the sync render path.

**Architectural lesson:** any tab with derived analytics must render a skeleton immediately and defer heavy derivation. Budget every tab at first-meaningful-paint <1 s warm, <2 s cold. Enforce with a perf regression test, not a promise.

### 11. Native crashes from third-party patches need defensive try/catch at the boundary

`AIIUzBeK`, `AC0AeyMF`, `AHhgUl6i`, `AEXP_nvFy`, `AGC7oEKyp` — all same crash: `react-native-health` HKCorrelation enumeration threw `NSException` on iOS 26.5, taking the app down before any JS-side guard could catch it.

**Architectural lesson:** every native patch for a third-party library must wrap enumerator callbacks (HealthKit, CoreBluetooth, AVFoundation, etc.) in `@try/@catch` + log. Don't rely on JS-side `try/catch` around a bridge call — bridge calls are asynchronous and the native exception has already unwound by the time JS hears about it.

### 12. Partial fixes that only address half a surface

`APo0qS9v` fixed per-serving metadata in the search subline but left the big kcal number per-100g (caught later as `AKvgjnb` / `APGJJlg`). `AAegi1DJ` fixed household create via the REST route but missed that the iOS error dialog came from a different `.single()` call (later surfaced as `AB75VswCe`).

**Architectural lesson:** when closing a ticket, walk every callsite of the affected data path before marking ✅. Tests should pin not just the happy path but the sibling surfaces.

## Build → IDs map

Quick reverse-lookup: which IDs were closed by which shipped build.

- **build-10** (`e2c2884`): early E-tracks. IDs covered by sub-entries E-1..E-*.
- **build-11** (`ef2a9f4`): 17 F-tracks. Includes F-1 (JS-only HealthKit guard), F-5 (recipe `normaliseSource` SSOT — closes `AI-CNKcmy`, `ACEH_Ilshz`, `AMAxKVVxP`), F-17..F-20 (Today/barcode polish — closes `AIjmgrBMm`, `ABs9n0AyF`, `ADACe4M`, `AIOek8w6`), plus household `.maybeSingle()` + unique-member migration (closes `AB75VswCe`).
- **landing fix** (`9a9a2fd`): honest-claims SSOT — closes `AC2JP5CG8x`.
- **build-12** (`515124d`): G-tracks. G-1 (ObjC `@try/@catch` for HealthKit crashes — closes all four crash IDs), G-2 (shopping stale-items + dedupe — closes `ALU8hrB1I`), G-3 (weight chart y-axis + range — closes `AGJmliHT`, `ACoMvhUoe`), G-4 (maintenance chain explainer — closes `ALcwMFPjf`), G-5 (household per-member number labels — closes `AJKHqJeCi`), G-6 (CSV export — closes `AC4oDEnQ0`).
- **build-12 H-tracks** (in flight): H-2 per-serving headline number, H-3 Today Maintenance column parity, H-4 Progress perf, H-5 Plan day delta. Will close `AKvgjnb`, `APGJJlg`, `AEb7NcjnvK`, `AH8csBqt`, and the still-latent half of `AAtW7dYcCBP`.
